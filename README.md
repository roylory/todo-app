# Next TypeScript App

This application was built as part of a coding test with Endpoint.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager, but `npm` or `yarn` should work as well.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone
    cd todo-app
  ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3032` to see the application in action.

## Notes
I did not use any unit testing framework for this project, as I was not sure if it was required.
